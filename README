This plugin will probably be most used in an admin-environment. Simply apply it to an input-field that'll save an vimeo-video-id and supply it with your vimeo-user-id (shortcut URL or ID).

$('input[name=vimeo_id]').vimeo_select('jpunt');
$('input[name=vimeo_id]').vimeo_select(2650748);


You can also add some additional settings:

$('input[name=vimeo_id]').vimeo_select(2650748, {auto_hide:true, thumbnail_size:'large'});

auto_size: This will automatically hide the select-box when a video is selected.
thumbnail_size: Setup the size of thumbnails (large/medium/small)
text_help: Title in top of the select-box
text_close: Text instead of just "x"

Styling is really basic, but easily overridden with classes vs_container, vs_header, vs_videos, etc
